# Turbo-Pup
8DOF Wheeled Robotic Dog Project

## Overview
Welcome to this robotic puppy project repository! This project combines the power of the Turbo Drive, an ESP32-based controlling board for motion control, and a Raspberry Pi 4B for advanced functionalities like gait planning, systematic modeling, and sensory extensions.

## Features

### Turbo Drive:
- **ESP32-S3**: Faster operation speed and capable of multithreading/core tasks.
- **Motor Control**:
  - Capable of controlling 8 leg servo motors.
  - Capable of controlling 4 wheel BLDC motors.
- **Current Sensing**: Inline current sensing for all four leg servos.
- **Signal Isolation**: All motor-driven signals are isolated by linear drivers.
- **IMU**: Integrated on-board IMU chip.
- **Display**: Utilization of an extended mini I2C OLED screen for extra status and information display.
- **Battery Monitoring**: Battery voltage monitor can be projected onto the mini I2C display.

### Raspberry Pi 4B:
- **Gait Planning**: Coordinated movement planning.
- **Visual System**: Camera integration for environment perception.
- **Module Integration**: Support for additional modules.
  - Laser radar SLAM for mapping and navigation.
- **Interactive Display**: Customizable faces displayed on a screen for communication.

### Additional Features:
- **Modular Design**: Easily expandable and customizable architecture.
- **PlatformIO and Arduino Structure**: Well-organized project structure for easy development and maintenance.

## Roadmap

### Main Objectives
- [x] Motion control for leg servo motors.
- [x] Motion control for wheel motors.
- [x] Math solvers.
- [ ] Gait planner.
- [ ] IMU integration.

### Extended Objectives
- [ ] Utilize extended I2C OLED screen for status display.
- [ ] Implement visual system with camera.
- [ ] Customizable faces display.
- [ ] Implement additional modules.

## Getting Started
I will need to start with some programming, so this part will be added first after finishing the main objectives.
